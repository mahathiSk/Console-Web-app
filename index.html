     We use Consol Screen for testing purposes.
     Right Click on the Output page and at last you would be able to find A word called "Inspect" Click on that you will see some options like Element, Console, Sources, Network, Performance so that Click on the Console you can see the output of the Command you have given in the JS and for printing something in console you can use the code called console.log.
